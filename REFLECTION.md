# Reflection

TODO: Write 200+ words that address the following questions. When you are done, delete this line, as well as the quesiton text. 

- In what ways did this project meet the goals set out in planning.md? If your project idea changed, that's okay! Just explain those changes here.
- What would you do to further achieve these goals if you had more time?
- How do your references, in combination with the capabilities of VPython, influence the feeling and the meaning of your piece? It's okay if your references are no longer obvious in the final product, but write about how they altered the process for you.
- How did working on this project change your skills as a coder?
When it comes to Python and VPython, do you feel the language and library are well-designed? Is there anything that could change to make the language more effective?
